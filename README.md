# Upgrading

Open the Polyglot web page, go to nodeserver store and click "Update" for "Purple Air".

Then restart the Purple Air nodeserver by selecting it in the Polyglot dashboard and select Control -> Restart, then watch the log to make sure everything goes well.

The nodeserver keeps track of the version number and when a profile rebuild is necessary.  The profile/version.txt will contain the profile_version which is updated in server.json when the profile should be rebuilt.
